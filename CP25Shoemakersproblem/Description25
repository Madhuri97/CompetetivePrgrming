Input Format

The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

First line of input contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). The next N lines each contain two numbers: the time and fine of each task in order.

Output Format

For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

You programm should print the sequence of jobs with minimal fine. Each job should be represented by its number in input. All integers should be placed on only one output line and separated by one space. If multiple solutions are possible, print the first lexicographically.
